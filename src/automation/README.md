# Workflow Automation Module

This directory will host the logic and components related to workflow automation features within the application.

It will include:
- Type definitions for rules, triggers, and actions (`workflowTypes.ts`).
- The core rules engine for processing automation logic (`workflowEngine.ts`).
- Definitions of specific automation rules applicable to the application (`workflowRules.ts`).
- Potentially, UI components for managing automation rules if required in the future.
